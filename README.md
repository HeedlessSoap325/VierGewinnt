# About this Project
This Project is a very simple clone of the Game "Connect Four". It has both a Web application, coded in javascript and html, as well as a Console Application, coded in Java

# Running the Web Application
Just open th File ./scr/main/resources/VierGewinnt.html and click on "Start Simulation".

# Running the Consoe application 
Just Run the File ./scr/main/java/ch/bbw/mf/VierGewinnt.java in any way you like. 
I would recomend to not open it in an IDE, becaus the Terminals ther can't be cleared and the Application Clears the Screen every Time, a new Move is performed. 
In an IDE, the Game will not look and function as good as in a Console.
