# About this Project
This Project is a very simple clone of the Game "Connect Four". It has both a Web application, coded in javascript and html, as well as a Console Application, coded in Java

# Running the Web Application
Just open th File ./scr/main/resources/VierGewinnt.html. By clicking in the coresponding circle, your Tokenwill be place there and fall to the Bottom.
You can change every aspect of the Game by modifying the Constants at the Top of the File.

# Running the Console Application 
Just Run the File ./scr/main/java/ch/bbw/mf/VierGewinnt.java in any way you like. 
I would recomend to not open it in an IDE, becaus the Terminals ther can't be cleared and the Application Clears the Screen every Time, a new Move is performed. 
In an IDE, the Game will not look and function as good as in a Console.

You can change every aspect of the Game by modifying the Constants in the File CONSTANTS.java.
